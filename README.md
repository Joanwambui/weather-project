# weather-project
This was my first github repository ðŸ˜…. I plan to grow and improve with every commit I make in future.That being said I performed Exploratory Data analysis on this project using the dataset I provided.It was a project involving Python and dived in to answer some of the questions that may develop from reviewing and understanding this particular dataset.In future I plan to do some modeling now that the dataset was ready to be processed.
